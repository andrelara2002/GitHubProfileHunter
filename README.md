# training_EC6
This is just a training file, if you want to send me some tips about how to get my code better I'm here to listen!
experience is the best way to get where you want.

---------------------------------------------------

the main goal of this application is to use Javascript EC6+
with webpack and babel features to get this working in all
the existing web browsers until this moment.

I really don't think if it will works in another computer but
if someone could test it for me, thanks :D. That's not a beautiful
interface but write your username, hit the add button and it will
get your personal github profile!

Maybe in a V2, I'll add a new interface


Edit 01
- A few days ago my project was having inssues with security, I'm sorry about that but I don't know how to 
fix that, take care when you try to use this file. Please, if someone know how can I fix that, let me know.
Thanks!
